==========
obmenux 1.3.0
==========

obmenux is an Openbox menu editor, written in Python, based on obmenu.
It allows editing menus in an intuitive way.

REQUIREMENTS:

  Python = 2.7, pygtk, python-glade

INSTALLATION:
	
  Download and extract the folder for the version you want.
  
  Open that folder in a terminal.
   
  Type:
    sudo python2 setup.py install
    
  or, to install without installing the pipe menu commands:
    sudo python2 minisetup.py install
    
  The setup script will show you what it did. Then obmenux should be installed.

USE:
  
  Open the editor window by entering:
    obmenux
  on any command line if obmenux is installed.
  
  (Whether or not it is installed, you may run it when the current directory is
  the obmenux version folder.)
  
  If your openbox menu for a session isn't named menu.xml, specify the file:
    obmenux $HOME/.config/openbox/session-menu-name.xml
  
Pipemenu use:
  
  To make an automatically filled menu choose "Add" click on "Pipemenu" and
  enter a command for one of four different kinds of pipe menus included
  with obmenux, as follows:

  obmx-dir <directory> <application to open files in the directory>

  obmx-nav <starting directory for menu> <file manager> <terminal emulator>

  obmx-moz -b "<bookmarks file>" -n "<web browser>"

  obmx-xdg <Gnome .menu format file>
      (If your system has any .menu files, they may be in /etc/xdg/menus)

  < > in those definitions means substitute a filename, command name, or path.
  The quotes may be omitted if there are no spaces in the name or path.

  The paths to files or directories should be written relative to your home
  directory or starting with "/" for root.
  
  If you get any errors or empty menus, try running those commands in a
  terminal to see whether they produce as much <XML> as they should, or error
  messages.

  There are additional options for those pipe menu scripts documented in the
  file "pipes-help" in this folder.
  
  Many other Openbox pipe menus are available.
  See http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Pipemenus

Details about how installation works:

  "sudo" is necessary just because users don't usually have permission to write
  to their system's /usr/local/ which is for locally installed software and not
  for a Linux distribution's standard packages. Although Unix was originally a
  single-user system, where it might be expected that a user would have such
  permission, Linux is not Unix, and provides multi-user security instead.

  According to how Python "distutils" works on your system, the installer may
  write the following files:

    ./build                   -- the build directory in the same folder

    /usr/local/bin/obmenux    -- allows running obmenux from any directory

    /usr/local/lib/python[version]/dist-packages/obxmlx.py
                              -- a library file for code shared by all the
                                 commands installed

    /usr/local/lib/python[version]/dist-packages/obmenux[version].egg-info
                              -- some library management that may differ on
                                 different systems
                                 
    /usr/local/share/obmenux  -- directory where the gfx files are stored
    
  and, if the pipe menus are installed:
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-dir    -- makes a menu from the files in a directory
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-nav    -- makes a menu to navigate directories
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-moz    -- makes a menu from a bookmarks.html file
    /usr/local/bin/obmx-xdg    -- makes a menu from a Gnome .menu file
    $HOME/.cache/obmenux -- where some pipe menus cache results for speed

  The installation should allow continuing to use other versions of obmenu that
  are not named obmenux. If obmenux has errors or causes any interference with
  any other program, that would be an issue to report.
  
CHANGELOG:

- 1.3.0 new features:
    - icon support (shows icons, allows setting icons, including by file
      browser with preview)
    - helpful messages in case of any file errors, instead of crashing
    - cache files for the pipe-menu scripts are placed in $HOME/.cache
      (instead of directly in $HOME or in $HOME/.local/share) making it
      obvious that they are cache files that can be deleted harmlessly
    - any arrangement of menus and their ids can be viewed and edited, even
      invalid arrangements that would hide menus and links from showing up, so
      that broken menus can be fixed, and menus with circular references won't
      crash the menu editor
    - (sorry, obmenux still has no support for action tags other than
      <command> or <execute>, such as tags that set startup notification and
      window locations)

- 1.2.0 new feature: separator labels shown and editable (including potentially
      by scripts using the obxmlx module, so the addition of that feature is
      technically sufficient reason for incrementing the semantic version)
    - Openbox 3.4 to 3.6, Lubuntu, and LXDE compatibility, by <command> tag
      contents being shown and editable, and <command> tags replacing
      the deprecated <execute> tags when editing their contents
    - New Separator shortcut key changed to Shift-Ctrl-S, because Ctrl-S was
      blocked by already being assigned to Save (a bug since obmenu 1.0)
    - Delete key on keypad also recognized
    - clicking on New Menu before selecting anything is fixed to make a new
      menu as it should (and not make the menu displayed different from the one
      that would be saved, which it turns out was a bug since obmenu 1.0)
    - debugging messages reduced to show in terminal only on failures, and
      other code clean-up

- 1.1.26 looks and acts neat enough to be usable
           (keeps items visible when moving, when original obmenu 1.0 wouldn't,
            and opens menus when moving items into them, which obmenu can't,
            and blanks Action box when there's no selectable Action,
            unlike obmenu 1.0 which grays the box, freezing mismatched info)
         
- 1.1.25 tested pipemenus with patches and better instructions.

- 1.1.24 precise versioning.

- 1.1.1 moves items between menus (or into or out of menus, including
  moving menus into or out of menus) (deprecated use with Python 2.3 to 2.6)

- Version 1.0-2 has Debian patches to the specific file named obmenu
    - enabled closing the help window by its "Close" button
    - enabled creating .config/openbox/menu.xml if it doesn't already exist.

- Automatically reconfigures Openbox when saving a file.

- Creates and modifies pipemenus. Pipemenus are a way of creating menus
  dynamically. For more info, visit Openbox documentation. (http://openbox.org)

- Creates "link" menus, which are references to other menus by their IDs.
  That way you can reproduce a sub-menu in several places in a whole menu file.

- Lots of GUI enhancements.

- Multifile support (New, Open, Save, Save As)
