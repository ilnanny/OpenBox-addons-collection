## A recursive-random text finder with potential support for parallelization
#

# It tries to find a substring inside a given text, starting at random positions, by
# splitting (recursively) the text into halves, stopping when the window is too narrow.
# If the substring exists inside the text, it returns "true". "false" otherwise.

# This is the visual version of the algorithm.
