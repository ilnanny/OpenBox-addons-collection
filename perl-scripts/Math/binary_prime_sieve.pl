# An experimental binary sieve for prime numbers.

=for comment

We can represent the first n numbers (greater than 1) as a sequence of 1-bits in the following way:

    11111 is equivalent with (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

From this, we can start XOR-ing and AND-ing the bits until they end up representing only the prime numbers.

Example:

    x = 11111111

    p = x
    x ^= 101010
    x &= p

    p = x
    x ^= 1001
    x &= p

In the end, x is: 11010100, where each bit of 1 represents a prime number in the following set: (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

Visualizing this, each number that has a bit of 1 in its corresponding position, is a prime number:

    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

For making this a general-purpose sieve, more work is required.

    $z   += 0;
    $sum += $z;

    my $prev = $t;
    $t ^= formula($z) >> $sum;
    $t &= $prev;

    say "$z -> ", todigitstring(formula($z) >> $sum, 2);
    say "t -> ", todigitstring($t, 2);

    ++$k;
}
