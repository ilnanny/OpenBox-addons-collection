dbbolton's pipemenus

This github repository is a collection of pipemenus that I have created
for Openbox.

dolphin-bookmarks.pl	duplicates the "bookmarks" set in dolphin, or any
			program using user-places.xbel

ob-sysinfo.pl		dummy menu that prints user@host, distro, kernel
			arch, uptime, current load, active memory, current
			Openbox theme, the date, and the time

thunar-bookmarks.pl	duplicates thunar's bookmarks, or any program using
			the .gtk-bookmarks file

pcmanfm-bookmarks.pl	works around a quirk that PCManFM writes in the
			.gtk-bookmarks file
