# It seems that Bake's python support is pretty buggy, at least in the
# snapshot we use (which, I agree, is pretty old).
# The script is correctly compiled to a .pyc file, but it's copied in
# the project-data-directory and then a bash-script in /usr/bin calling
# python on it is created (which doesn't work, as it searches for the .py file).
#
# To avoid that, we install the launcher script to /tmp, and then manually
# link the compiled executable to binary-directory/openbox-vera-color.
